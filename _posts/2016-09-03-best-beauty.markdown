description: A CMS driven digital platform that shows off the products featured in Stylist Magazine's 2016 Best Beauty Awards. The main challenge here was balancing an awards site with the makings of a shop. With some foreseeable UX concerns I got straight to building a prototype on a device to play with. Whilst behind the scenes the product needed to be used again for other product collections, such a "Christmas gift guide".
